This code provides an efficient tool for solving mathematical puzzles where missing variables in an equation must be filled using the digits 1 to 9, each exactly once. By inputting the equation as a string—including variables, parentheses, and operators (+, -, *, ^ for exponentiation)—the function tests all unique digit assignments and returns one solution as a list, or `None` if no solution exists.

#### Example Equations:

- For `a+b=4`, possible solution: `[1][3]`  
- For `a*b-c=71`, possible solution: `[8][9][1]`  
- For `(a*b*c)-d = 128`, possible solution: `[3][5][9][7]`  
- For `(a*(b+c))-d = 44`, possible solution: `[3][6][9][1]`  
- For `b^c-d=129`, no valid solution with distinct digits 1-9, so output: `None`  

With this tool, users can easily explore solutions for a range of equations, including those using exponentiation, while the program reliably indicates when no answer is possible under the given constraints.
